# 🧮 Epsilon RootFailureFinding Assignment

## 📌 Problem Statement
This project implements **Newton-Raphson** and **False Position** methods for root finding.  
It demonstrates **situations where these methods fail or converge poorly**, such as:
- ❌ Bad initial guesses
- 🌀 Multiple roots
- ⚠️ False Position method getting stuck  

The goal is to analyze **why these failures happen** using code, report, presentation, and graphs.

## 🚀 How to Run Code
1. Go to the `code/` folder  
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp functions.cpp -o rootfinding
